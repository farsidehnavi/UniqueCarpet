Color Palette

Use warm, deep, earthy tones. Handmade carpets survive centuries for a reason; they don’t scream for attention, they sit there quietly judging your furniture.

Primary Colors

Deep Ruby / Persian Red
#8B1E1E
Warm, classic, instantly signals “handcrafted tradition.”

Antique Gold
#C49A51
Works for headings, accents, borders, and subtle highlights.

Secondary Colors

Midnight Teal
#0F3E3E
Dark enough for elegant contrast. Great for navbars or footers.

Carpet Brown
#4A2E1F
Your “neutral anchor.” Works for text if you avoid using pure black.

Background Colors

Cream / Parchment
#F5EEDF
Gives an old-world, handcrafted feel.

Soft Earth Gray
#E3D7C5
For cards, product boxes, section backgrounds.

If you mix these properly, you get a website that feels like tea-stained paper, hand-knotted wool, and slightly overpriced craftsmanship. Perfect.
